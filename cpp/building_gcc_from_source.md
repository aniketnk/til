# Building GCC from source
> Fri May  8 02:36:29 IST 2020

GCC 10 released on 07-May-2020, and I wanted to build it from source. \
This was tested on macOS Catalina, but the instructions should work the same with other GNU/Linux systems too!

Note: The official instructions can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html), but I wish to demonstrate a friendlier way(without mentioning all the optional paramters) to install from source.

**WIP** (Incomplete)
